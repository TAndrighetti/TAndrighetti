# Hi, I'm Tahila Andrighetti 👋

I’m a bioinformatician / computational biologist focused on **single-cell transcriptomics** and **systems/network biology**, with a strong interest in **reproducible pipelines** and clean, well-documented analyses.

### About me 
- Bioinformatics + programming background, working end-to-end from **raw sequencing files** (FASTQ/BAM) to **biological interpretation**.
- Main expertise in **scRNA-seq**: QC, normalization, clustering, integration, annotation, and downstream analyses.
- Comfortable bridging **R + Python** workflows (e.g., integrating Seurat-based steps with Python/scverse analyses).
- Strong focus on **data quality and rigor** (I’m the person who will double-check every identifier before it goes to a table).
---

## What I’m working on now
- **scRNA-seq analysis pipelines**: QC, normalization (including scran-based strategies), clustering (Leiden),and iterative **cell-type annotation**, using mainly Python (**scverse**), but with R integration when needed (mainly Seurat).
- **BD Rhapsody scRNA-seq** data handling: dealing with large FASTQ files, demultiplexing performance, and read-level troubleshooting to recover **gene sequences** (not only counts).
- **Network biology**: filtering real TFs in OmniPath TRI, diffusion-kernel workflows (TieDIE), and integration with causal/network frameworks.
- **Reporting & delivery**: generating clean **HTML reports from notebooks** (nbconvert) with better navigation and readability for collaborators.

## Selected themes I like working with
- Single-cell biology, annotation strategies, and robust QC decisions.
- Host–[[microbiota]] interactions and immunology-driven questions.
- Network-based interpretation (TF activity, regulatory wiring, perturbation/causal thinking).
- Turning messy data into **clean, shareable, reproducible outputs**.
