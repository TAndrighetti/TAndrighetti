### About me 

- Bioinformatician working primarily in **Linux environments**, with **Python** as the main programming language, complemented by **Bash** and working knowledge of **R** for integrative analyses.
- Expertise in **end-to-end scRNA-seq analysis workflows**, from raw sequencing files (FASTQ/BAM) through QC, normalization, integration, clustering, annotation, and functional interpretation.
- Specialized in **systems biology and network-based analyses**, leveraging signaling and regulatory networks to address biological questions beyond gene lists.
- Research focus on **host–microbiome interactions, immunology, and inflammation**, including **IBD**, immune cell biology, microbial virulence factors, and gene regulation in health and disease, often integrating **multi-omics** data.
- Committed to **reproducible science and data rigor**, with experience in pipeline development, workflow standardization, and meticulous validation of identifiers, annotations, and results.
